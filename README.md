==========

RadioFeedz aims at letting you get, save and listen to your favourite podcast, right in your pocket.

## How does it work ?

You add your favourite RSS feed (be it a podcast feed, a news feed, a picture feed) to RadioFeedz.

RadioFeedz lets you refresh your feeds any time while online and retrieve the latest news and podcasts.

You download your podcasts to your Android device with few clicks.

All your podcasts/news are in your pocket to listen, read, watch anytime, on the bus, on the plane or in your living room.


## How do I find these "RSS feeds" ?

Most (if not all) news websites have RSS feeds. There is usually a link on the home page to the RSS feeds (search for RSS, for this icon <img alt="RSS feed icon, from Wikimedia, uploaded by user Anomie" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/43/Feed-icon.svg/128px-Feed-icon.svg.png" height="30px" width="30px" />, for podcasts, ...).

Once you find one of these feeds, copy the url to the RSS feed, then open your app and press the action button + at the top-right of the main screen. It is going to suggest you to add this feed. Press Yes and enjoy your podcasts and news!

### Examples

I first developed this app for the podcasts from France Inter, a French radio. The RSS feeds are available for each talk-show. Go to the page of the show, click the menu item "podcast" and click "s'abonner au podcast via RSS". Copy the url of the page that opened, copy it and then open the RadioFeedz app and click the + button at the top-right of the screen.

It is possible to listen to the recently popular podcast "Serial" by going to ...

## There are bugs, the application crashes, what do I do ?

I tried to test my app as I could, but I probably forgot some bugs. Do not hesitate to [open an issue in Github][gh-issues] if you find one. If you do, please be as precise as you can (what feed you used, what button you pressed ...). In particular, some feeds might not work as expected (as I tested only the few feeds I follow).
